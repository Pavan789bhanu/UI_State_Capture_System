2. No action has been taken yet, as indicated by "N/A" in the action description. The page is in a state where the user can choose a template to create a new document.

3. The next step would likely involve clicking on the "Blank document" template to start a new document, as instructed in the step description. This will open a new document in a separate tab for editing.
