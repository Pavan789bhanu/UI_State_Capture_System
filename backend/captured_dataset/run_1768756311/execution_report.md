**URL:** `https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/?pli=1`

1. The screenshot shows the Google Docs homepage with a "Start a new document" section featuring template options like "Blank document" and various resume and project templates. There's a "No text documents yet" message in the "Recent documents" section, indicating no previously accessed documents.

2. The page is in a default logged-in state, displaying available templates for starting a new document. No specific action has been taken yet within this step.

3. The next expected action would be to select a document template to create a new document or to wait for UI automation to trigger further actions such as opening an existing document if any become available.
