## Step 1

![Step 1](step_3.png)

**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/settings/import-export`

1. The screenshot shows the "Import / Export" settings page of Linear, featuring options for importing data from Asana, GitHub, Shortcut, and Jira using buttons. There's also a section for exporting data in CSV format with an "Export CSV" button.

2. No specific action has been taken as indicated by "N/A on 'N/A'." The page is simply displaying the available import and export options.

3. The next expected action could be selecting an import option to start importing data or clicking "Export CSV" to export the current workspace data.

**➜ Action Taken:**  
_The automation navigated from the "Import-Export" settings page to the "New Team" settings page, reflected by a URL change from `/import-export` to `/new-team`. This transition indicates the system redirected to the page for configuring a new team within the workspace._

## Step 2

![Step 2](step_5.png)

**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/settings/new-team`

1. The screen displays the settings page for "MyWorkspace" with sections like "General," "Members," and "Slack notifications" under administration options. It also shows "Issue labels," "Templates," and "Recurring issues" under "Issues, projects, and docs."

2. The action taken was navigating to the URL for creating a new team. The screen is currently showing the workspace settings rather than the intended "New Project" step.

3. Next, the user may need to navigate back to the project creation section, as they are currently in the team settings area. Clicking on "Create a team" or exploring the navigation sidebar may help in reaching the correct page.

**➜ Action Taken:**  
_After clicking on 'Create a team,' the UI displayed additional options on the same page, enabling the user to initiate a new project setup without changing the URL._

## Step 3

![Step 3](step_7.png)

**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/settings/new-team`

1. The screenshot displays a "Teams" page with a list of teams in a workspace. A search bar for filtering by name and a dropdown to filter by activity status are visible. On the right side, there is a prominent "Create team" button.

2. The action taken involved clicking the "Create team" button, suggesting the user navigated to a page intended for creating a new team rather than creating a project.

3. Upon clicking the "Create team" button, it is likely that the user will be redirected to a form or page where they can input details for the new team. This will allow the user to configure team settings and add members.

**➜ Action Taken:**  
_Upon clicking the 'Create team' button, the page navigated away from the team creation form to the project's dashboard, indicating a successful team setup and redirect to the projects overview at a new URL._

## Step 4

![Step 4](step_12.png)

**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/projects/all`

1. The screen displays the "Projects" section of a workspace on Linear. The left sidebar includes navigation options such as "Inbox," "My issues," and a section for the user's workspace with links to "Projects," "Views," and "More." The main area describes the concept of projects with buttons labeled "Create new project" and "Documentation."

2. The page is currently in a default state, showing information about the projects feature without any active projects. No specific action has been taken.

3. The user might proceed by clicking the "Create new project" button to initiate a new project setup process or explore documentation for more information on managing projects.

**➜ Action Taken:**  
_Between Steps 4 and 5, the UI automation executed an internal process to commence the third cycle of adaptive verification. Although no visible changes occurred on the screen and the URL remained the same, this action prepared the system for further data validation steps within the workspace's project environment._

## Step 5

![Step 5](step_15.png)

**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/projects/all`

1. The screenshot shows a "New project" creation page in a project management app. Key UI elements include input fields for "Project name" and "Add a short summary," along with buttons labeled "Backlog," "No priority," "Lead," "Members," "Start," "Target," "Labels," and a section to write a description.

2. No specific action has been taken on this page yet; it remains in the initial state of project setup, awaiting user input to define project details and settings.

3. Next, the user is expected to fill in the project details such as the name, summary, and other attributes, and then click the "Create project" button to save and initiate the new project.
