## Step 1

![Step 1](step_3.png)

**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/settings/import-export`

1. The screen displays the "Import / Export" section of a workspace dashboard in Linear, with options to import data from various services like Asana, GitHub, and Jira. There is also an option to export issue data as a CSV file.

2. The page is in a ready state for import/export actions, showing options but no action has been initiated yet (indicated by the “N/A on N/A”).

3. Next, the user might choose an import source or click the "Export CSV" button to export data. Once an action is selected, the corresponding process will begin, such as exporting existing issue data or starting an import setup.

**➜ Action Taken:**  
_The automation transitioned from a settings page to the active team page by executing a navigation action, resulting in the URL change from the settings/import-export section to the team/MYW/active section within the workspace. This indicates a shift from configuring or viewing import-export settings to managing or viewing details of an active team._

## Step 2

![Step 2](step_17.png)

**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/team/MYW/active`

1. The screenshot displays a task management interface with a list of to-dos under "MyWorkspace." Visible UI elements include the side navigation menu with options like "Inbox" and "My issues," a filter bar with "All issues," "Active," and "Backlog" buttons, and four tasks labeled MYW-1 to MYW-4 with titles such as "Get familiar with Linear" and corresponding due dates (Nov 25).

2. No specific action has been taken on this screen. The page is in a state where tasks are listed under the "Active" filter, indicating ongoing tasks that require action or completion.

3. Next, based on the context, users might interact with the listed tasks by clicking on them to view details, update their status, or mark them as complete. The user may also alter the view by changing filters or accessing different workspace sections via the side navigation menu.
