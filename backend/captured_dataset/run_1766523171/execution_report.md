**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/settings/import-export`

1. The screenshot shows the "Import / Export" section of a workspace settings page in Linear. It includes options for importing data from various services like Asana, GitHub, Shortcut, and Jira, as well as a button for exporting issue data in CSV format.

2. The page is in a state where it displays import options and information, but no action has been taken yet, as indicated by "Action taken: N/A."

3. Next, a user might select one of the import options to start transferring data into Linear, or initiate a CSV export by clicking the “Export CSV” button, leading to an email with the download link when the export is ready.

**➜ Action Taken:**  
_After the user initiated an action, the system redirected from the "Import/Export" settings page to the "All Projects" overview, indicating a navigation to view or manage the list of current projects within the workspace._
