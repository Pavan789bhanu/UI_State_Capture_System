**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/settings/import-export`

1. The screen shows the "Import / Export" settings page of an application, displaying options for importing data from services like Asana, GitHub, Shortcut, and Jira. There's also an option for a "Linear to Linear import" and a CLI importer section for advanced users. The "Export" section at the bottom offers a button to "Export CSV."

2. The current state of the page is active and ready for the user to choose an import or export option, but no specific action has been taken yet.

3. Next, the user might select an import option to bring data into the application or click the "Export CSV" button to export their data, which will trigger the application to prepare the CSV file and email it once ready.
