2. The action taken matches a post-login state, where the application is handling the authentication response and is likely setting up the user session.
3. Once the loading is complete, the user should expect to be redirected to the main dashboard or home page of the application, where further interaction with the app can take place.

**➜ Action Taken:**  
_In Step 1, an authentication action was completed, redirecting the user from the Google authentication callback URL to their Linear workspace URL, where they now have access to view all projects within "myuniqueworkspace456"._
