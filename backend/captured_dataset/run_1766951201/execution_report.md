**URL:** `https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/`

1. The screen displays the Google Docs homepage, featuring a search bar at the top, template options like "Blank document" and various document templates, and a section for "Recent documents" which currently shows "No text documents yet."

2. The state of the page indicates a successful login to Google Docs, as evidenced by the user profile icon in the top-right corner, showing account details. The user hasn't selected a document yet.

3. The next expected action would be for the user to either create a new document by selecting a template or import an existing one. This will populate the "Recent documents" section with relevant content.
