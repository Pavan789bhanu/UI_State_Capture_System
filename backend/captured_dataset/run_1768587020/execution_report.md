![Step 1](step_3.png)

**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/settings/import-export`

1. The screen displays the "Import / Export" section within the settings of a workspace on Linear, featuring options like "Asana," "GitHub," "Shortcut," and "Jira" for importing data. There are also sections for using a CLI importer and an "Export CSV" button.

2. Currently, no action has been taken on the screen, and it appears the user is viewing available options for data import and export.

3. Next, the user might select one of the import options to bring data into Linear from another service or use the "Export CSV" button to export current data.

**➜ Action Taken:**  
_The automation navigated from the "Import Export" settings page to the "New Team" page, likely by selecting the "Projects" section from the sidebar, resulting in a URL change reflecting the new section focus._

1. The screenshot displays a "Create a new team" page where users can input details to form a new team. Visible fields include "Team icon," "Team name," and "Identifier," along with options for team hierarchy and copying settings from existing teams.

2. Currently, no action has been taken regarding the input fields, and the description field remains unfilled. The page is in a state where team details can be entered and settings configured.

3. Next, the user is expected to fill in the "Team name" and "Identifier" fields, configure any additional settings as needed, and possibly initiate the create team process by using a related button, possibly to proceed with team creation.
