**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/settings/import-export`

1. The visible elements on the screen include an "Import / Export" section with options for importing data from services like Asana, GitHub, Shortcut, and Jira, as well as an option for Linear to Linear import. There is also a "CLI importer" section and an "Export" section with a button labeled "Export CSV."

2. The page is in a preparatory state for importing or exporting data, with no specific action taken yet as indicated by “N/A on 'N/A.'” The UI displays options for users to choose the service from which they want to import data or to export the current workspace data.

3. The next expected action is likely for the user to choose an import option by selecting one of the buttons for a service or to initiate an export by clicking the "Export CSV" button. After this, the system will either begin the import process or generate a CSV file for export.
