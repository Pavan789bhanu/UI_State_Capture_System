**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/settings/import-export`

1. The screen displays the "Import / Export" settings of the Linear workspace dashboard. Visible elements include import options for Asana, Shortcut, GitHub, and Jira, as well as options for Linear to Linear import and a CLI importer. Additionally, there is an "Export CSV" button for exporting issue data.

2. The page is in a neutral state with no specific action taken; it simply presents options for importing and exporting data. No particular function or button is actively engaged at this stage.

3. Next, the user might choose to initiate an import by selecting one of the available services or proceed with exporting data by clicking the "Export CSV" button. Depending on the chosen action, the application will either import data from an external service or prepare the data for export as a CSV file.
