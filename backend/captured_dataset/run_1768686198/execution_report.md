## Step 1

![Step 1](step_3.png)

**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/settings/import-export`

1. The screen shows the Import/Export settings page in a web application. The sidebar on the left lists navigation options, with "Import / Export" highlighted. The main section displays import options for various services like Asana, GitHub, Shortcut, and Jira, alongside export functionalities, including an "Export CSV" button.

2. No specific action has been taken as the step describes clicking on the "Projects" option, which is not currently visible or highlighted. The page remains in the Import/Export section, ready for user interaction to import or export data.

3. The next expected action would be navigating to the "Projects" option in the sidebar, which would redirect the user to the Projects page.

**➜ Action Taken:**  
_The automation navigated the user from the Import/Export settings page to the New Team settings page by clicking on the Projects option in the sidebar, resulting in a change in the URL to reflect the new page location._

**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/settings/new-team`

1. The screen displays the "Create a new team" page, where users can specify a team icon, name, and identifier. It also includes sections for setting the team hierarchy and copying settings from an existing team.

2. Currently, inputs appear unpopulated as no specific action has been taken or data entered. The page is in a setup state, ready for user input to create a new team.

3. Next, the user is expected to fill out the fields for the team name, identifier, and determine whether to copy settings from an existing team. Once filled, they will likely submit the information to proceed with team creation.
