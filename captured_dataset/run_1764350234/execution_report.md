1. The screen displays a Miro board titled "PI Planning" with several objects selected, indicated by the bounding box around them. There is a sidebar on the right titled "Agile Coaching" which offers options such as "Analyze engagement patterns" and "Create Kanban setup."

2. The page is in a state where 45 objects are selected on the Miro board, as noted below the board in the popup. No specific action has been taken yet as the action is labeled as "N/A on N/A."

3. Next, the user might choose one of the Agile Coaching options such as designing a Kanban setup or analyzing engagement patterns. This could involve interacting with the selected objects on the board to implement agile techniques.
