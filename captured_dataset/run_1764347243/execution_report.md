## Step 1

![Step 1](step_3.png)

**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/inbox`

1. The screenshot shows the Linear app's interface after logging in, displaying an "Inbox" section on the main dashboard. The sidebar includes sections for "Workspace" and "Your teams," with options like "Inbox," "My issues," "Projects," and "Views." The main area indicates "No notifications."

2. The page is in a state where the user's inbox is currently empty, with no new notifications or messages to display.

3. Next, the user might expect to navigate to other sections such as "My issues" or "Projects" to manage tasks or view team activities. Additionally, new notifications might appear as tasks are updated or created.

**➜ Action Taken:**  
_The automation likely navigated from the inbox to the projects overview page within the "myuniqueworkspace456" workspace. This is indicated by the URL change from the inbox to the projects endpoint, suggesting a shift from managing tasks to viewing all projects._

## Step 2

**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/projects/all`

1. The screen displays the "Projects" section of a workspace without any active projects. It shows a central icon with a description of "Projects" and two buttons: “Create new project” and “Documentation.” The sidebar includes navigational links to "Inbox," "My issues," and "Projects."

2. The action taken is clicking on the "Create new project" button to initiate the process of creating a new project.

3. Clicking "Create new project" will prompt a form or dialog to gather information about the new project, allowing the user to enter details and eventually save or start the project.

**➜ Action Taken:**  
_Upon clicking the 'Create new project' button, a project creation form appeared on the same page, allowing the user to input details for a new project within the existing workspace. The URL remained unchanged, indicating in-page interaction._

**URL:** `https://linear.app/myuniqueworkspace456/projects/all`

1. The screen displays a "New project" form within a workspace, where fields for "Project name," "Add a short summary," and "Write a description" are visible. There are buttons for categorizing the project, such as "Backlog," "No priority," "Lead," "Members," "Start," "Target," and "Labels."

2. The page is in an idle state where no text is entered into the fields, and the keyboard is currently not in use. 

3. Next, the user is expected to input the project details into the available fields and select the appropriate categorization options before clicking the "Create project" button to finalize the setup.
